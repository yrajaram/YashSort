/*
 * This is a linear order sort algorithm which depends on the maximum element and the minimum element in the input. 
 * For example if the maximum value is 100 then this will perform in O(100) irrespective of the number of elements in the input array.
 * Contrast this will Bubble Sort which with perform in O(100) if 10 elements are in the input array and will be O(400) if 20 elements
 * are in the input.
